            <h2>First Steps in Programming</h2>
            <p>My journey into the world of programming began in 2020 when I enrolled at Aptech School of Computer Education, located in the Garki Area 11 branch. I was excited to learn about the core building blocks of web development, starting with HTML and CSS. These fundamental languages opened my eyes to the world of web design, allowing me to create and style websites. As I continued my studies, I quickly realized the importance of making websites not just look good, but also function seamlessly. That’s when I was introduced to JavaScript. JavaScript was a game-changer for me, enabling me to add interactivity to my websites, from simple forms to dynamic elements. It sparked my passion for programming and motivated me to explore even deeper into the tech world.</p>

            <h2>Building My First Project</h2>
            <p>After mastering the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I felt ready to take on a real-world project. That’s when I decided to build my first web application: a simple to-do list app. It was thrilling to see how the code I wrote could be turned into something functional that solved a real-world problem. The process involved not only writing the code but also ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate. As I built this project, I learned how to manage and organize my code, as well as how to implement simple features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks. This experience solidified my passion for programming. i was also introduced to courses such as Bootstrap, SQL, Angular and C+. This expirience made me realize, creating apps that could help people was something I wanted to pursue further.</p>

            <h2>Further Education and Online Learning</h2>
            <p>After completing my diploma in web development, I decided to further my education by pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of the People (UOP) in the United States. This decision opened up new doors for me in the field of technology. The program allowed me to delve deeper into more complex topics such as algorithms, data structures, and computer systems. It was eye-opening to learn how these fundamental concepts lay the groundwork for everything that I had learned so far. During breaks from school, I didn’t stop learning. I took various online courses on platforms like Coursera, FreeCodeCamp, and W3Schools. These platforms offered a vast array of tutorials, which kept me updated on the latest trends and technologies in the programming world.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Front-End Development with eHealthAfrica</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am exploring front-end development through a specialized program by eHealthAfrica (eHA). This program has been incredibly rewarding, and I am learning a lot about building dynamic, user-friendly web interfaces. What excites me most about the program is the opportunity to apply modern web technologies, such as React.js, to create responsive and engaging websites. Through eHA, I have worked on several projects that challenge my understanding of web development and encourage me to think critically about user experience and design principles. Some of the key aspects I’m enjoying about the program include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning HTML and Css, which are the essentials in learning web development.</li>
                <li>Building projects that tests my understanding of programming principles.</li>
                <li>Collaborating with fellow developers on projects, which helps me learn new techniques and improve my teamwork skills.</li>
                <li>Staying current with industry trends like responsive design, making sure my websites are mobile-friendly.</li>
                <li>Improving my debugging skills and optimizing code for better performance.</li>
