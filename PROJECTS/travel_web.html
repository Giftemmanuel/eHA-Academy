    <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Pagoda</h3>
            <img src="https://shorturl.at/l4Mn9" alt="Canoe on Body of Water With Pagoda Background"> 
            <p>a serene body of water, its surface reflecting the vibrant hues of the surrounding landscape in
                 Bali. In the background stands the iconic Ulun Danu Beratan Temple, a multi-tiered pagoda that
                  appears to float gracefully over the water’s edge. This temple is nestled along Lake Beratan,
                   one of Bali’s most breathtaking bodies of water, framed by lush green mountains and often 
                   veiled by a soft mist that adds a mystical ambiance. The pagoda, dedicated to the goddess of
                    water, features distinct Balinese architecture, with dark, layered roofs and intricately
                     carved stone sculptures, blending harmoniously with the natural surroundings. As the sunlight
                      changes throughout the day, the lake and temple reflect shades of gold, emerald, and deep 
                      blue, creating a tranquil scene that embodies Bali’s deep spiritual connection to nature.

            <h3>the Gate at the Lempuyang Temple</h3>
            <img src="https://shorturl.at/VnO4m" alt="Back View of a Woman Running Towards the Gate at the Lempuyang Temple, Bali, Indonesia"> 
            <p>The Gate of Lempuyang Temple, known as the “Gates of Heaven,” is a majestic stone gateway that 
                perfectly frames the distant silhouette of Mount Agung, Bali’s highest and holiest volcano. This
                 split gate, with its intricately carved patterns and towering height, opens up to breathtaking
                  panoramic views that seem almost otherworldly. Visitors standing between the two pillars often
                   feel as though they are stepping into another realm, with the sky reflected in the glossy stone
                    floor below, making it a popular spot for capturing Bali’s beauty in its most mystical and 
                    awe-inspiring form.

            <h2>Places to visit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Ubud palace </h2>
                    <img src="https://shorturl.at/IqcHI" alt="an im"></li>
                    <p>The palace has beautifully crafted buildings with high aesthetic value. The walls and 
                        doorways have a distinctive design carved in stone, and of course, there is also a temple
                         inside the palace. You can wander around, explore the buildings and items, and pay heed
                          to the details of every object of the Balinese traditional cultures there – or take some
                           shots for your Instagram as well! The palace is also equipped with an auditorium and a
                            banyan tree as a shelter during the daytime.

                    private guide takes you to a number of waterfalls where you can admire the cascading waters
                     and take a dip in the refreshing pools. You also get to enjoy a typical Balinese lunch at a
                      local restaurant as part of your experience.

                    <img src="https://shorturl.at/0pCZy" alt="">
                    <p>You don’t need to hike through the night to experience the magic of Bali’s Mt. Batur
                         volcano. This private 4WD tour, with 2-way transfers direct from your Ubud hotel, gets
                          you into eerie landscapes of volcanic sands and lava caves. You’ll take in island views,
                           explore the forest, and soak in the healing waters of a natural hot spring. For ease, 
                           your package includes lunch (or brunch) and bottled water. <!--https://shorturl.at/0pCZy-->
