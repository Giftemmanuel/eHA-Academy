            <em>Nobody’s born smart.</em> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
            There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10</strong>.<br>
            And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</strong><br>
            Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
            Slowly. Surely. <strong>You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</strong><br>
            <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
            Until one day, <em>you walk.</em><br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</strong><br>
            <em>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</em><br>
            <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
            <em>You just don’t get it, yet.</em><br>
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
            </p>

            You only have to know one thing:<br>
            <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
