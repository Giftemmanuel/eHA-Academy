        <h1>Title Of Poem: Path of the Dreamer </h1>
        <p>Through twilight’s veil, the dreamer walks,<br>
            Where silence hums and shadows talk.<br>
            The stars above in whispers say,<br>
            "Dream bold, young soul—forge your way."<br>
            <br>
            With every step through night’s soft maze,<br>
            Hope glimmers like a morning blaze.<br>
            The winds may shift, the roads may twine,<br>
            But still your heart beats, clear and fine.<br>
            <br>
            For those who dream don’t walk alone—<br>
            The universe makes paths unknown.<br>
            In every fall, a lesson gleams,<br>
            In every loss, the birth of dreams.<br>
            <br>
            So hold your head and chase the sky,<br>
            Let doubts and fears fall low, drift by.<br>
            The gift of dreams is yours to keep,<br>
            Awake or not—fly wide, or sleep.<br>
            <br>
            And when the world begins to see,<br>
            The dreamer will have set it free.</p>
