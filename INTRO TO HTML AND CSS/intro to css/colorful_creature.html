<h2>About chameleons </h2>
<p>The <em>chameleon</em> is awesome because <strong>it can change colors to blend in with its surroundings. <br></strong> 
     <em>It</em> also have this cool ability to <strong>move each of their eyes independently, allowing them to <br>
     look in two different directions simultaneously. </strong> This helps them detect predators and prey <br>
     more efficiently.</p>
